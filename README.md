# Transfer-Learning-Between-Berries

This Project explored the application of Transfer Learning (TL) from a model pretrained on the data of one berry to another.

The data used in this project includes the final preprocessed satellite images stored in final_hist.npy, it was obtained similarly to what was done in https://github.com/M-Gastli/Strawberry-Yield-and-Price-Forecasting.
